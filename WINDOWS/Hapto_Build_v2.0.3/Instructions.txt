This Application uses a command console (the green panel) 
which is always open in the top right of the screen. In 
order to operate a test you'll need to run a few commands. 
To run a command simply type in the lowest text field and 
hit enter to run it. 

When text in here is presented in double quotes "" this is
a command to run. Anything on the inside of those with 
square brackets [] is pseudo code and meant to be where you
enter data you want based on your procedure context.

In order to know trial information there is a plain black
panel below the command console which displays the current
round (called DataLogger_[round number]) and trials tabbed
beneath each one (called Test_[trial number]). Use this
panel to know what trial is currently being completed
and to keep track of which trial you want to omit/delete
from the results if it's data is contaminated with 
a device issue.



[VOCABULARY]
Starting Position: keep device level and flat, with the bending 
	parts facing upwards, and the blue cable facing 
	away from you
DataLogger/logger: this is what the application calls a round
	of trials
Test: this is what the application calls an individual trial
Pedal: this is a usb foot pedal, or can be replaced by pressing
	'e' on the keyboard or moving a joystick downward on a
	connected xbox controller (the 12th axis, usually left
	stick's up and down axis)



[RUNNING A SESSION]

STEP 1 _ Set up a session:
1 - Use the command "prefs set 15 15 15 15 10 0.1" 
    (to set the number of trial types, the same amount 
    as prior procedure)
2 - Use the command "prefs update logger" 
    (to apply prefs to rounds you'll create)

STEP 2 _ Run desired testing rounds:
1 - Use the command "add logger [desired round number]" 
    (to create a round)
2 - If the device is in the Starting Position
    The participant can now press the pedal whenever
    they are ready to start a trial
3 - The participant should match the twin version
    of their device for each trial and press the pedal
    when they feel they are close to a match
4 - In between each trial you may notice that on ZERO_DOCK
    trials the twin is flat, this also calibrates the device
    it is vital that they hold it in the Starting Position
5 - Complete the number of trials assigned until there
    are none left and they receive the "You're Done!"
    message on the floating box
6 - Use the command "summarize logger [desired round number]"
    (to summarize the round's data, it will create an
    additional summary and trial category summary file, 
    THIS IS CRUTIAL FOR SUMMARIES OF ALLDATA)
7 - Repeat these steps until desired number of rounds are 
    completed by the participant (do 2 of them to complete
    the same amount as prior procedure)

STEP 3 _ Get the summary of all data:
1 - Use the command "add logger alldata" 
2 - Use the command "summarize logger alldata"
    (this will create an alldata report folder with
    summaries of all trials across all rounds) 



[READING RESULTS]

Drag and drop desired data from a text file into an excel
sheet and set the cell seperator to TABS.



[HELP SECTION] 

If the device is acting weird:
1 - Ask the participant to lower the device to a level surface, 
    with the bending parts facing upwards, and the blue cable 
    facing away from themselves (the starting position)
2 - Turn on Show Debug Keys in the command console
    (if it isn't already on) 
    and press 'o' on the keyboard to re-calibrate the device
3 - The participant can now pick up and use the device again

If a trial has contaminated data from device/unknown error:
1 - Use the command "delete logger [desired round number] 
    [desired trial number]"

If something SUPER WEIRD is occuring:
1 - Use the command "reload"
2 - Start Session procedure over
_Didn't work?:
1 - Unplug the HaptoBend device and pedal
2 - Close application 
3 - Plug the HaptoBend device and pedal back in
4 - Restart the application
5 - Start Session procedure over
